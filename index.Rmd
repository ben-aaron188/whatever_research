We're a research group that works on topics around behavioural inference, core issues of natural language processing, data science and applications thereof. For more detail on topics, see the projects and interests of the members listed below. All communication happens on our Element channel.

In weekly meetings, we discuss ongoing research, pitch ideas or discuss a paper. The [timetable](#timetable) below is for reference of the current members.

If you're interested in getting involved (as a student, intern or project collaborator), feel free to reach out to any of the [current members](#current).
